# Artificial-Neural-Network
This is an artificial neural network I had to make for coursework.

I created it as part of my Uni work during Year 2.

It requires the user have 3 files (all .csv 's):
  - Training Set
  - Validation Set
  - Training Set

It can handle many ANN features:
  - Batch Processing
  - Momentum
  - Annealing
  - Weight decay (Unreliable)
  - Alternate Sigmoid function (Commented out)

It was designed so that it can have as many hidden nodes as you want, 
with as many inputs also. It will ask you for these features before 
running and then create a single model. It also outputs all of the 
expected vs. predicted values for the final model.

It will then output the weights at each node to a text file along with the overall MSE of the model created.
